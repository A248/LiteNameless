	 * If the player has multiple permissions corresponding to different group IDs,
	 * the plugin will use the last group ID in the configuration list.  <br>
	 * 3. The plugin will update the user's group on the Nameless website. <br>
	 * <br>
	 * The procedure is done asynchronously blocking the main thread. <br>
